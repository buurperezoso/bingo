### `Overview`

This Mexico themed bingo was created with ReactJS using Typescript, Lottie files and styled using css scoped in modules. It took 5hrs more-less, last hour was used mostly on adding the winning animation and testing. There were some dependencies not used due to the time limit, I went for a more simple but working approach.
